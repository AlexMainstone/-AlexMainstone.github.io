### Looking at Game Engines
This week I have been looking at Game Engines and frameworks. I'd prefer to use something I'm somewhat familiar with, so I'll be looking at engines I've already used.

## Unity

I'm fairly familiar with unity, I have made some tiny experiments and followed a few tutorials but ultimately made nothing of significance.

### Pros
- Widely used
- Well documented
- Huge community
- Asset store

### Cons
- Not much personal experiance
- More personal experiance with similar engines
- Vague sense of dislike (it just weirds me out a bit)

## Godot

I'm really familiar with Godot 2.0, small tweaks have been made since then, but overall I'm more familiar with it than I am Unity.

### Pros
- Open Source & Community Funded (not at all relavent but hey it's nice)
- Intuitive project structure and inheratance system
- I'm familiar with it

### Cons
- Smallish community, but friendly and helpful
- Lack of tutorials (Still a lot though)
- Documentation can be frustrating at times

## SFML
SFML I've done a lot of work with, but it's more of a framework than an engine. It'll take a very long and difficult time to make anything meaningful

### Pros
- I'm familiar with SFML
- Complete software and hardware control
- Lower level programming than the average game engine

### Cons
- I have to mess with advanced game architecture
- I'll spend more time structuring code than developing the game
- Incapable of 3D

## Conclusion
I'll use godot, it's capable of 3D and I'm familiar with it. Unity I haven't touched much and SFML is far too time consuming to make anything meaningful, by using Godot I can quickly create a game, allowing me to focus on the most important aspects of the game instead of messing with rendering and advanced architecture. I think me being familiar with it is the biggest thing Godot has going for it, otherwise I'd use Unity.
