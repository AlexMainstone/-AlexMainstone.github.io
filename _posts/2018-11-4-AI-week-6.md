### Enemy Types
I decided my game was rather tame, so to increase tension I'll add a couple new enemy types.

## The Pawn

The pawn moves straight at the player, meaning there is no pathfinding, but they're faster than the player meaning that the player has to use the environment to shake them off. For the movement I just interpolate the pawn's position with the players. Easy and simple!

## The Queen

I wanted the player to always to be in danger, which is why I added the queen. The queen chases the player through the level, not the fastest enemy but it's a looming threat that the player has to take into consideration while waiting for a rook to finish its patrol.

## Conclusion
I havent added the most content this week, but these 2 enemies introduce some important diversity to gameplay.
