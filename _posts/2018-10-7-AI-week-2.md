### Concept
This week I'll be explaining the concept of the game I am going to create and designing the environment

## Overview
I was thinking about what kind of game would best be able to demonstrate different kinds of AI, so I decided to create a stealth game. I was thinking a game in the style of the original metal gear solid, which would be relatively simple to pull off, yet be mechanically conplex.

So, my priority in my game will be creating enemies that patrol an area, look around for the player and can spot the player, lose the player and remember a last known location of the player. Enemies will be able to kill the player when they have seen them, the goal will be to sneak around the enemies and make it through the level.

## Environment Design Considerations
- Locations to block the vision of enemies
- A navigation mesh that covers the whole level
- narrow hallways that will require that the player get into close proximity to the enemies
- corners that the player can use to avoid enemies

## Environment Design
I will create a dungeon, the player will be a wizard that has stolen some magic item from the dungeon and has to escape.

### Sketch
I will create a mockup that I can base my implementation off next week, this map will be simple and only intended to show off my AI:

- First enemy: will introduce the player to the enemies of the game.
- Second: Will be an enemy patrolling a path that conflicts with the player
- enemy hallway: will be a lot of enemies patrolling around a hallway
- final room: will be some kind of undecided difficult obstacle

## Conclusion
I have designed an environment for my game that I can implement next week. I have also laid out the foundational ideas of my game.
