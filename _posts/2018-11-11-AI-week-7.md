### Adding enemies to the map
This week I placed my enemies and player in my world environment.

## Placement

### Rooks
The rooks have been spaced out pretty sparsely in all but the last room. I want to be able to show off the rooks in an environment where nothing else will kill me so the first one is good for that.

### The Queen
The queen starts right behind the player, she's a threat right from the start!

### Pawns
The pawns are placed in such a way that they wont be a threat until halfway through the level. There's also an overhang before the final room that stops them following you.

## Some other minor changes
- I added arrows to the rooks so that you can tell what direction they're facing
- I added torches to the map
- I added music but then disabled it immediately because it became annoying.
- I tinkered with the worldenvironment, this made the background black
