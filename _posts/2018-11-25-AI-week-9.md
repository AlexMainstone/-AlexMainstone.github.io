### Our 3D models
I realised that I never went over the import of our 3D models. So I'll be doing that this week

## Chess pieces

The chess pieces are untextured, I found a model for each chess piece and I opened it up in blender, deleted some objects like the camera and light source and then expoted it as a .DAE file, which is the only type of model that godot can recognise, which is really annoying for me. Then I just converted the .dae files to godot scenes in editor and voila! Our chess pieces are now in game.

## Player

The player was the biggest pain, first up finding a human rigged model was a pain, but I found a great resource for this:

Mixamo lets me export the model as a .DAE file, unfortunately I can only export the model with a single animation at a time, so I found myself copying the models into the editor multiple times and then copying the animation using godot and pasting them all into one model's AnimationPlayer node. I decided that the textured model didnt really fit the games simplistic asthetic, so I decided to just make him green.

## The gridmap tiles
I used some minecraft textures in the gridmap to give the scene some variety. Simple but effective.
